### Solution: Download and host images locally

**Option A** - Quick fix for now:
- Images are in AI Drive at `/whealton_family_project/photos/`
- Use AI Drive tools to regenerate URLs when needed

**Option B** - Permanent solution (recommended):
1. Download images from AI Drive
2. Create `images/celta/` and `images/lynn/` folders in website
3. Replace blob URLs in HTML with local paths like `images/celta/photo.png`
4. Upload images with the website

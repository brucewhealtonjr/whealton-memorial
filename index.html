                <p class="lead">
                    This memorial honors two extraordinary women whose lives, though cut short, 
                    left an indelible mark on the heart and soul of Bruce Whealton and all who knew them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through love, they taught the meaning of being seen, valued, and cherished. 
                    Through courage, they faced life's challenges with grace and determination. 
                    Through their memory, they continue to inspire healing, hope, and human connection.

                        She made no demands, offered no judgments, and for the first time, I felt seen."

                    <p>
                        Celta was Bruce's first deep love, a nurturing soul who offered unconditional 
                        acceptance during his early twenties. Their relationship, though brief, was 
                        transformative—teaching him that he was worthy of love and capable of profound connection.

                        Lynn was Bruce's life partner, fiancée, and greatest love. A poet, artist, and 
                        woman of remarkable courage living with Cystic Fibrosis, she shared over a decade 
                        of deep partnership with Bruce—creating a home, a poetry magazine, and memories 
                        that would last forever.

                <p>
                    Both Celta and Lynn gave me something I had never known in my childhood: 
                    the feeling of being someone's most important person. They listened, they cared, 
                    they believed in me when I struggled to believe in myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After Celta's tragic death in 1991, I thought I might never love again. 
                    Then Lynn entered my life in 1992, and I discovered that love could be even 
                    deeper, more passionate, and more transformative than I ever imagined.

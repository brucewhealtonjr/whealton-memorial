                        The first woman who made me feel truly seen and valued. Our brief but profound connection at Georgia Regional Hospital in 1990 transformed my understanding of love and self-worth. Though our time together lasted only a year, her impact resonates through every day of my life.

                        My soulmate, my partner, my greatest love. From our first meeting at poetry readings in Wilmington in 1992 through decades of shared creativity, laughter, and profound connection, Lynn's presence illuminated my world. Despite cystic fibrosis and countless challenges, our love story became an epic novel of devotion and resilience.

            <h2>About This Memorial</h2>
            <p>
                This website serves as a lasting tribute to two extraordinary women whose lives, though tragically cut short, 
                left an indelible mark on the world and on my heart. Through their stories, preserved in poetry, prose, and 
                cherished memories, their spirits continue to inspire and guide.
            </p>
            <p>
                These memorials draw from published works including <em>Memoirs of a Healer</em>, <em>Overcoming Shyness & Loving Lynn</em>, 
                <em>Tell Me I'm Not Invisible</em>, and <em>What Really Matters: Poems About Love, Loss & Trauma</em>. Each page 
                contains passages from these books, woven together to tell their complete stories.

            <p>
                Both Celta and Lynn taught me profound lessons about love's transformative power. Celta awakened me to the possibility 
                that I was worthy of love—the first person to truly see me. Lynn showed me that love could flourish even in the face 
                of chronic illness and overwhelming challenges. Together, they shaped who I became: a healer, a writer, a man who 
                understands the sacred gift of being seen, valued, and loved.

The love, it's in the memories...

                <h2>The Beginning: April 1992</h2>
                <p>
                    I came to Wilmington, North Carolina in April 1992, still grieving the loss of Celta eighteen months 
                    earlier. I was broken, carrying the weight of that tragedy, uncertain if I would ever feel whole again. 
                    I found solace in the local poetry scene, attending readings where words and emotions flowed freely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's where I met Lynn Denise Krupey. She was a regular at the poetry readings, a vibrant presence 
                    with golden hair and a spirit that seemed to light up the room. Despite my shyness, despite my grief, 
                    I found myself drawn to her. And somehow, miraculously, she was drawn to me too.

                <h2>Our First Date: July 4, 1992</h2>
                <p>
                    Our official first date was July 4th, 1992. We went to the jetty at Carolina Beach, where the ocean 
                    met the sky in an endless expanse of blue. We walked, we talked, we began to discover each other. 
                    It was the beginning of something neither of us fully understood yet—a love that would define both 
                    our lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout that summer and into fall, we spent more and more time together. Poetry readings, walks 
                    by the Cape Fear River, quiet moments where words weren't necessary. I was falling in love, though 
                    my shyness and past trauma made it difficult to express.

                <h2>Our First Kiss: October 1992</h2>
                <p>
                    October 1992 brought one of the most memorable moments of my life. We were at Wrightsville Beach, 
                    walking along the shore. The moment felt suspended in time—the sound of waves, the feel of sand 
                    beneath our feet, the electricity in the air between us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And then it happened. Our first kiss. In that moment, everything else faded away. There was only 
                    Lynn, only us, only the profound connection we were building together.

                <h2>Becoming "Us": July 2, 1993</h2>
                <p>
                    We dated throughout the fall and winter, our bond growing deeper with each passing week. But it 
                    wasn't until July 2, 1993, that we officially became a couple. That was the day we exchanged those 
                    three powerful words: "I love you."
                </p>
                <p>
                    For me, those words carried the weight of everything Celta had taught me about being worthy of love. 
                    For Lynn, who had her own struggles with cystic fibrosis and the challenges it brought, those words 
                    were a promise of partnership, of facing life's difficulties together.

                <h2>The Engagement: Late May 1994</h2>
                <p>
                    Late May 1994 brought what I still consider the brightest moment of my entire life. I took Lynn to 
                    a jewelry store to pick out an engagement ring. When she realized what was happening, when she 
                    understood that I was asking her to be my wife, tears of pure joy streamed down her face.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those tears—that moment—remains crystallized in my memory as the pinnacle of happiness. To see 
                    someone you love that deeply, that completely, respond with such overwhelming emotion to your 
                    proposal... there are no words adequate to describe it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We couldn't legally marry due to Lynn's health insurance requirements related to her cystic fibrosis. 
                    But we didn't need a legal document to be married. We were married in every way that truly mattered—in 
                    our hearts, in our commitment to each other, in the life we built together.

                <p>
                    Lynn and I lived together as partners, building a life filled with creativity, love, and shared dreams. 
                    We co-founded Word Salad Poetry Magazine, bringing together our passion for words and our desire to 
                    create something meaningful in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had countless moments of joy—walks on the beach, poetry readings, quiet evenings at home. We also 
                    faced challenges together, particularly as Lynn's health fluctuated. Cystic fibrosis was a constant 
                    presence in our lives, but we refused to let it define our relationship or diminish our love.

                <h2>The Separation: Around 2000</h2>
                <p>
                    Around 2000, as Lynn's health declined more seriously, we made the difficult decision to separate 
                    physically, though never emotionally. The demands of her illness, the practical challenges of 
                    caregiving, and the complexity of our situation led us to live apart, though our love never diminished.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those years apart were painful, filled with longing and the constant awareness of time slipping away. 
                    We maintained our connection, our love story continuing even as circumstances kept us physically separated.

                <p>
                    In 2015, Lynn died from cancer. After years of battling cystic fibrosis, after surviving so much, 
                    cancer took her from this world. The grief was overwhelming, the loss immeasurable. The woman whose 
                    tears of joy had been the brightest moment of my life was gone.

                    But our love story doesn't end with her death. Love like ours transcends physical presence. The

                    things endure. They always will.

                <p>
                    Lynn taught me that love could heal, that partnership could transform, that even in the face of 
                    chronic illness and overwhelming challenges, joy and beauty could flourish. Our love story, though 
                    marked by separation and ultimately by loss, remains one of the greatest gifts of my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I remember Lynn, I remember her tears of joy at the jewelry store. I remember walking hand in 
                    hand on infinite beaches. I remember her golden hair flowing in the wind, her laughter, her strength, 
                    her incredible spirit. I remember being loved completely, unconditionally, forever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That love sustains me still. In every poem I write, in every memory I cherish, Lynn lives on. And 
                    in living on, she continues to teach me what really matters: love, connection, and the moments that 
                    define our lives.

                        Bruce had just moved to Wilmington, North Carolina, and started attending weekly 
                        poetry readings at the Coastline Convention Center. Among all the attendees, one 
                        woman stood out: Lynn Denise Krupey.

                        "I had just moved to Wilmington in April and I wanted to get to know the people 
                        there. So, I started attending poetry reading sessions... I would see Lynn every 
                        Sunday at the poetry readings... For me, she stood out among all the attendees 
                        that were present there."

                    <p>
                        After three months of gathering courage, Bruce finally asked Lynn to join him 
                        for a special poetry reading in Carolina Beach on the Fourth of July. What followed 
                        was a day that would change both their lives forever.

                        "So, now, it was July 4th of 1992. I picked her up at her home on Wrightsville 
                        Beach. We drove through Wilmington and continued toward Carolina Beach. It was 
                        somehow amazing just how easy the conversation was going for both of us."

                        They walked out to the jetty together. Bruce reached for Lynn's hand—and she 
                        took it.

                        My fingers crossed over her palm between the thumb and first finger on her hand. 
                        I felt a tingling sensation beginning in my fingers and rising up my arm, like 
                        the small soft waves beside us. The sensation came to rest in the center of my 
                        chest."

                        without hesitation or fear.... Her head was tilted slightly back and turned a 
                        bit to the right as my face tilted to the right. Her blond hair waved a bit in 
                        the gentle wind. I reached my arm over onto the sand, then brought my lips to hers."

                        mine. My legs started to get weak. ... Making Lynn this happy was a memory more

                    Lynn and Bruce created a home together north of Wilmington on Brucemont Drive—a

            <div class="story-content">
                <p>
                    Lynn was born with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), a rare genetic disease that affects about 
                    30,000 people in the US. CF causes excess mucus to build up in the lungs and digestive 
                    tract, leading to scarring and decreased lung capacity over time.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "It's also important to note that the girl of my dreams, the love of my life, the 
                    one person I would fall madly and passionately, totally and completely, in love with, 
                    had a chronic illness called Cystic Fibrosis."

                </blockquote>
                
                <h3>Daily Management</h3>
                <p>
                    Lynn had to take multiple pills with every meal and use inhalers and medications to 
                    maintain her health. Bruce learned the tapping exercises to help loosen mucus in her 
                    lungs. They drove together over two hours to her clinic appointments in Chapel Hill, 
                    where doctors monitored her oxygen saturation and lung capacity.
                </p>

                <h3>The Insurance Dilemma</h3>
                <p>
                    Despite being engaged and living as husband and wife, Lynn and Bruce couldn't legally 
                    marry. To qualify for the state health care plan that covered her CF treatment, Lynn's 
                    income had to remain below a certain threshold. As a married couple, their combined 
                    income would have exceeded that limit, potentially ending her medical coverage.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "As I mentioned, Lynn and I couldn't have a wedding because our combined income might 
                    make her ineligible for the state health plan that would cover her treatment... The 
                    fact that we didn't have a wedding didn't change anything. So, my commitment to Lynn 
                    was forever."

                </blockquote>

                <h3>Her Courage</h3>
                <p>
                    Despite the challenges, Lynn lived with remarkable grace and determination. She didn't 
                    let CF define her—she was a poet, an artist, a partner, and a force of nature who 
                    refused to be diminished by her illness.

                <p>
                    In 2000, as Lynn's health declined, their life together faced its greatest challenge. 
                    Lynn eventually returned to her mother's home on Wrightsville Beach for additional 
                    care and support. Though they didn't officially break up, Lynn told Bruce she might 
                    not come back. There was never closure—just a painful, unresolved parting.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "On about the fourth of September of 2000, I heard Lynn tell me that she might not 
                    come back to me. I couldn't even begin to have a 'logical' conversation about this 
                    because I broke down and started crying."

                    Bruce tried to reconnect with Lynn in the years that followed, but it never worked 
                    out. Lynn died in 2015 from cancer. Bruce discovered this loss long after it happened, 
                    adding another layer of grief—he was not mentioned in her obituary.

                    "Some people have questions like what happened to my first wife, Lynn. She died in 
                    2015, I found out. From cancer. There had been no 'we' for all these years. Merely 
                    talking about her and what happened has been so painful."

                    <p>
                        Lynn Denise Krupey lived courageously, loved deeply, and left an indelible mark 
                        on everyone who knew her. Her poetry, her strength in facing chronic illness, her 
                        playful spirit, and her capacity for unconditional love transformed Bruce's life 
                        and gave him the foundation to help countless others as a therapist and writer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She is remembered not just for the years they shared, but for the love that never 
                        died—a love that continues to inspire and heal, even now.

                <h2>The Power of Being Seen</h2>
                <p>
                    Before Celta, I had grown up in an environment of profound emotional deprivation. My childhood was marked 
                    by parental abuse and emotional neglect that left me feeling invisible, worthless, and fundamentally unlovable. 
                    I had never experienced what it meant to be truly seen, valued, or cherished by another person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then came Celta Camille Head in 1990, and everything changed. Though our relationship lasted only a year, 
                    its impact was nothing short of revolutionary. For the first time in my life, someone looked at me and 
                    saw value. Someone chose to spend time with me not out of obligation, but out of genuine affection. 
                    Someone said "I love you" and meant it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I wrote in <em>Tell Me I'm Not Invisible</em>: "After I was with Celta, I felt like I was ten feet tall." 
                    That simple statement captures a transformation so profound it defies adequate description. She didn't just 
                    love me—she awakened me to the possibility that I was worthy of love. She didn't just see me—she helped 
                    me see myself as a person of value for the first time.

                <h2>Our Story: 1990-1991</h2>
                <p>
                    I met Celta at Georgia Regional Hospital in Augusta, Georgia in 1990. She was there being treated for 
                    anorexia, struggling with her own demons and challenges. Despite her own pain, she had room in her 
                    heart to see mine. She extended kindness, attention, and eventually love to someone who had never 
                    experienced those gifts before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our days together followed a precious routine. I would visit her daily at the hospital, and we would 
                    walk the grounds together, hand in hand. We talked about everything—our hopes, our fears, our dreams 
                    for the future. She wrote me detailed diary-style letters that I treasured, each one a testament to 
                    the depth of her thoughts and the generosity of her spirit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We spent time at the Botanical Gardens in Athens, Georgia, walking the winding paths together. Those 
                    walks became my escape, my "other life"—a world where I wasn't the damaged, worthless person my childhood 
                    had taught me I was, but simply a young man in love, worthy of being loved in return.

                <h2>The Moment Everything Changed</h2>
                <p>
                    There was one particular moment that captured the essence of what Celta meant to me. Three of us were 
                    walking in a small field—Celta, myself, and her friend. There was a swing, and Celta sat on it. As the 
                    swing moved back and forth, there came a pause in time when our eyes locked, and everything else faded 
                    from our awareness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In that suspended moment, I understood what love truly was. Not an abstract concept, not something you 
                    read about in books, but something you feel in your body, in the silence, in the return of the swing. 
                    It was the first time I had ever experienced such a connection with another human being.

                <h2>The Tragedy</h2>
                <p>
                    On New Year's Eve 1990, transitioning into 1991, Celta died in a house fire. She succumbed to smoke 
                    inhalation—a sudden, senseless tragedy that took her from this world far too soon. She was only in her 
                    early thirties, with so much life ahead of her, so much love still to give.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The grief was compounded by additional pain: Celta's mother refused to allow me to attend her burial. 
                    I was denied the chance to say a proper goodbye, to stand at her graveside and honor her memory alongside 
                    others who loved her. That denial added another layer of trauma to an already devastating loss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have carried that loss with me every day since. The woman who first taught me I was worthy of love, 
                    who first made me feel "ten feet tall," was gone. But the transformation she sparked in me—that could 
                    never be taken away.

                <h2>A Lasting Legacy</h2>
                <p>
                    Though Celta and I were together for only about a year, the impact of that relationship has lasted 
                    a lifetime. She was the first person who made me feel truly seen and valued. In a life marked by 
                    emotional deprivation and parental abuse, she was the one who showed me what love could be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I met Lynn eighteen months later, I was still grieving Celta's loss. But because of what Celta 
                    had taught me—that I was worthy of love, that I could be seen and valued—I was able to open my heart 
                    again. I was able to recognize and accept the profound love Lynn offered me. In this way, Celta's 
                    legacy lived on, making possible the next great love of my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every day, I remember her. Every day, I am grateful for the year we had together. And every day, 
                    I carry forward the lesson she taught me: that I am worthy of love, that I deserve to be seen, 
                    and that I am not invisible.

                        Celta Camille Head was born in 1958 and lived a life marked by creativity,

            <div class="story-content">
                <p>
                    In early 1990, Bruce Whealton met Celta at Georgia Regional Hospital in Augusta, Georgia, 
                    where he was volunteering with a social work team after graduating from Georgia Tech. 
                    Celta was being treated for anorexia, weighing under 60 pounds when they first met.
                </p>
                <blockquote class="featured-quote">
                    "When I met Celta, I explained that I was not approaching her as part of the staff or 
                    as part of my role on the social work team. The moment I approached her she smiled 
                    before I could even explain these facts."

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Their connection was immediate and profound. Bruce would visit her almost daily before 
                    she was discharged, and they would walk the hospital grounds together. Celta began 
                    writing diary-like letters to Bruce, sharing her innermost thoughts and observations 
                    in remarkable detail.

                    What developed between Celta and Bruce was more than friendship—it was a healing 
                    connection that changed Bruce's life forever. For someone who had never felt truly 
                    seen or valued by his family, Celta's unconditional acceptance was revolutionary.

                    Celta was characterized as nurturing, compassionate, empathetic, artistic, and a 
                    talented writer. Despite struggling with her own health challenges and addiction, 
                    she gave Bruce the validation and intimate connection he had been missing throughout 
                    his life.

                <p>
                    On New Year's Eve 1990/91, tragedy struck. Celta died in a house fire in Athens, 
                    Georgia, from smoke inhalation caused by an exposed electrical cord on a television.

                    Bruce received the devastating phone call on New Year's Day, 1991. At the funeral, 
                    he cried more than everyone else combined, his grief visceral and overwhelming. 
                    Heartbreakingly, Celta's mother instructed him not to attend the burial, denying 
                    him the chance for final closure.

                <p>
                    Though Celta lived only 32 years, her impact on Bruce's life was profound and lasting. 
                    She showed him what it meant to be loved unconditionally, to be someone's most important 
                    person, and to experience emotional intimacy without judgment or shame.
                </p>
                <blockquote class="featured-quote">
                    "This year with Celta, being seen through the eyes of love, was like waking up for 
                    the first time in my life. I was about to turn 24 in April, and the first 23 years 
                    of my life were something like a blur or a dream... Lacking something essential until now."

                    Celta's love gave Bruce the foundation he needed to pursue his calling as a mental 
                    health professional, to overcome his own trauma, and eventually to fall deeply in 
                    love again with Lynn Denise Krupey. Without Celta's transformative presence, Bruce's 
                    journey toward healing and self-actualization might never have begun.

                        "Despite the tragic loss of Celta, I gained valuable personal growth. She taught 
                        me that I was worthy of love, that I could be seen and valued, and that connection 
                        with another human being could heal the deepest wounds. Her memory lives on in 
                        every person I've helped as a therapist, in every word I've written about the 
                        power of love and attachment, and in my heart forever."

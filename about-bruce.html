                <h2>A Journey from Invisible to Healer</h2>
                <p>
                    My life story is one of transformation—from a childhood marked by emotional neglect and severe social anxiety 
                    to becoming a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, therapist, author, and advocate for those who struggle with trauma 
                    and mental health challenges. It is a journey shaped by adversity, illuminated by love, and dedicated to helping 
                    others find their voice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Before I ever knew the word for 'shame,' I had already absorbed its weight," I wrote in <em>Tell Me I'm Not Invisible</em>. 
                    "Not from a single moment of humiliation, but from a slow erosion of safety—emotional neglect that left me starving 
                    for comfort, for gentleness, for someone to notice my fear and say, 'You're okay.'"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Growing up, I suffered both emotional neglect and physical abuse. My mother's unpredictable rages and my father's 
                    emotional distance created an environment where I learned to become invisible—literally unable to speak in most 
                    social situations, a condition known as selective mutism. By junior high, I had become "a ghost in my own story," 
                    sitting in classrooms for years without speaking. Not once.

                <h2>Awakening Through Love</h2>
                <p>
                    At twenty-three, everything changed. I met Celta Camille Head at Georgia Regional Hospital in 1990, where I was 
                    volunteering while considering a career in mental health. Celta was being treated for anorexia, struggling with 
                    her own demons, yet she had room in her heart to see mine. She was the first person who ever made me feel truly 
                    seen, valued, and worthy of love.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "At twenty-three, I experienced what felt like waking up for the first time in my life," I recall. "After I was 
                    with Celta, I felt like I was ten feet tall." That one year with her—walking hand-in-hand at the Botanical Gardens, 
                    sharing dreams and fears—transformed my understanding of myself and what I could become. When she died tragically 
                    in a house fire on New Year's Eve 1990/91, the grief was overwhelming. But the transformation she sparked could 
                    never be taken away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eighteen months later, still grieving, I met Lynn Denise Krupey at poetry readings in Wilmington, North Carolina. 
                    Lynn, with her golden hair and extraordinary spirit, became my soulmate, my partner, my greatest love. Despite 
                    battling cystic fibrosis, she lived with grace, creativity, and an unwavering commitment to our love. The moment 
                    she cried tears of joy when I gave her an engagement ring remains "the brightest moment of my life."
                </p>
                <p>
                    These two women didn't just love me—they taught me that I was worthy of love, that connection could heal profound 
                    wounds, and that the transformative power of being truly seen could turn a life around. Their influence became the 
                    foundation for everything that followed.

                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Master of Social Work (MSW)</strong> - University of South Carolina, 1996</li>

                </div>

                <p>
                    My journey to becoming a therapist began with my own transformation. During my years at Georgia Tech, I worked 
                    intensively with a college counselor who taught me cognitive-behavioral techniques, social skills training, and 
                    graduated exposure therapy. I learned the "Three-Column Technique" for challenging distorted thoughts. I practiced 
                    "free information" conversation starters and active listening. Week by week, I deliberately put myself in 
                    increasingly challenging social situations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "By my senior year, I was amazed by how much I had changed," I wrote. "I had many friends—real friends who sought 
                    out my company. I was no longer the silent observer but an active participant." Psychology had done this for me—and 
                    I wanted to offer the same gift to others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I volunteered at Georgia Regional Hospital beginning in 1990, learning intake assessments, treatment documentation, 
                    and direct patient care alongside licensed social workers. After completing my undergraduate degree, I enrolled in 
                    the MSW program at the University of South Carolina, starting part-time in 1993 and full-time in 1994.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My graduate internships included work with children and families, and intensive clinical training at The Oaks 
                    psychiatric hospital under the mentorship of Chris Hauge, DSW, LCSW. There I learned experiential therapy, advanced 
                    group therapy techniques, and the therapeutic use of empathy and presence. When I graduated in May 1996, I already 
                    had a position waiting: Therapist at Brynn Marr Psychiatric Hospital in Jacksonville, North Carolina.

                <p>
                    Throughout my career as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), I have worked with diverse populations and 
                    complex clinical challenges:

                <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li><strong>Inpatient Psychiatric Care:</strong> Therapist on adult units providing individual and group therapy for severe mental illness, mood disorders, and acute crises</li>
                    <li><strong>Trauma & PTSD:</strong> Specialized work with trauma survivors using experiential techniques, guided imagery, hypnosis, and cognitive-behavioral approaches</li>
                    <li><strong>Dissociative Disorders:</strong> Trained in treating Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) through the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (ISSTD)</li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    I integrated multiple therapeutic modalities: cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), person-centered therapy (Carl Rogers), 
                    experiential techniques, clinical hypnosis, psychoanalytic principles, and trauma-informed care. My approach always 
                    centered on empathy, authenticity, and unconditional positive regard—the same qualities that had helped me heal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I served as President of the New Hanover County chapter of the North Carolina Society for Clinical Social Workers, 
                    organizing monthly peer meetings, continuing education workshops, and mentorship opportunities for fellow professionals.

                <p>
                    Writing has always been intertwined with my healing journey. Lynn and I co-founded <strong>Word Salad Poetry Magazine</strong>, 
                    one of the earliest online literary magazines, creating a platform for poets and writers to share their work. Our 
                    shared passion for poetry and literature became a cornerstone of our relationship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have published several books that explore themes of trauma, healing, love, and resilience:

                <p>
                    My writing is inspired by my own experiences—surviving childhood adversity, discovering love's transformative power, 
                    working as a mental health professional, and advocating for those whose voices have been silenced. Every book I write 
                    honors Celta and Lynn, whose love made my healing possible.

                <h2>Current Work & Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    After weathering further adversity—including the loss of Lynn, professional setbacks, and ongoing struggles with 
                    Complex-PTSD—I have rebuilt my life through peer support, advocacy, and writing. I became a <strong>Certified Peer 
                    Support Specialist (CPSS)</strong> in August 2021, returning to the mental health field to help others with lived 
                    experience of trauma, mental illness, and injustice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I work as a mental health professional at Freedom House Recovery Center, bringing decades of clinical 
                    expertise and lived experience to support individuals on their healing journeys. I continue to write, advocate, and 
                    speak truth to power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My mission remains unchanged: to help others who carry wounds similar to mine. To be present for those who feel 
                    invisible. To offer the same compassionate witnessing that Celta and Lynn gave me. And to prove, through my own story, 
                    that transformation is possible—that love can heal the deepest wounds, and that even those who begin in silence can 
                    find their voice.

                <h2>Personal Life</h2>
                <p>
                    After Lynn's health declined around 2000, we made the difficult decision to live separately, though our emotional 
                    bond never diminished. Lynn passed away in 2015 from cancer, leaving a void that can never be filled but a legacy 
                    of love that sustains me still.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2010, I married Elnaz Rezaei Ghalechi (Elee). Though we divorced in 2018, she remains part of my life and I am 
                    grateful for the time we shared.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, I continue to honor Celta and Lynn through my work, my writing, and this memorial website. Their love taught 
                    me that I was worthy—worthy of being seen, worthy of connection, worthy of a life dedicated to helping others. That 
                    lesson guides everything I do.
